### NYC_Restaurant_Inspection
As a current resident in NYC, it is very hard to choose which restaurant to go among countless restaurants in NYC. It might be harder to choose restaurants in NYC to some people, who care about sanitation a lot because of some health issues. The dataset, which includes NYC restaurant and college cafeteria inspection results for up to three years prior to the most recent inspection, can provide information on recent inspection results of current NYC restaurants. This project can be helpful for deciding which restaurants to be visited or not to be visited, especially to people who need to care a lot about their diets and cleanliness.
